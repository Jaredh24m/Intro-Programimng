# I had a lot of fun doing this project, although it represents a challenge for me because everything 
# I am learning is new, and it is my first time programming but I am happy to be able to achieve it. 
# I will give you the words that you use to be able to run my program: 
# Adjective: Angry
# Animal: Lion
# Verb: Eat
# Exclamation: Ow, Ouch
# Verb1: Run
# Verb2: Sleep
# Verb3: Left
# Verb4: looking
# Verb5: Thinking
# Exclamation: Food
# Verb6: See
# Noun: Fear
# Adjective: Happy
# Below I will post what I added to the story:

print("Plese enter the following:")
print()
adjective = input("adjective: ")
animal = input("animal: ")
verb = input("verb: ")
exclamation = input("exclamation: ")
verb1 = input("verb: ")
verb2 = input("verb: ")
verb3 = input("verb: ")
verb4 = input("verb: ")
verb5 = input("verb: ")
exclamation2 = input("exclamation: ")
verb6 = input("verb: ")
noun = input("noun: ")
adjective = input("adjective: ")
print()
print("Your story is:")
print()
print("The otherday, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very")
print(f'{adjective.capitalize()}, {animal.capitalize()}, {verb}, down the hallway. "{exclamation.capitalize()}!", I yelled. But all')
print(f"I could think to do was to {verb1}, over and over. Miraculously, ")
print(f"that caused it to stop, but no before it tried to {verb2}")
print(f"right in front of my family. So we {verb3}, in silence {verb4} at her majestic mane and {verb5}")
print(f'That we could have been her "{exclamation2.capitalize()}"!')
print(f"From now on we will only {verb6} him behind a cage, whitout {noun} and {adjective}")
